# Choice-Based Detective Game

An interactive detective story game where you make choices to progress. Built with React.

# What I Made

A simple detective storytelling game. You click on cards to go to different locations and the story moves forward. When you hover over cards, there's a 3D tilt effect and video animations play.

# Features

- Choice-based story system
- 3D card animations (follows mouse movement)
- Video animations on hover
- Custom cursor animation
- Story management through JSON

# Installation

```bash
npm install
```

# Running the Project

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`.

# How It Works

1. The `locations.json` file contains scenes and choices
2. Each scene shows different cards
3. Clicking a card takes you to a new scene
4. Moving your mouse over cards creates 3D effects
